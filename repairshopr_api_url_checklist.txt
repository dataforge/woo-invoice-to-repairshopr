# RepairShopr API URL Checklist

1. **Check your API URL in the plugin settings:**
   - It should look like: https://YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.repairshopr.com/api/v1
   - Replace YOUR-SUBDOMAIN with your actual RepairShopr account subdomain.

2. **Test the endpoint in your browser:**
   - Go to: https://YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.repairshopr.com/api/v1/payment_methods
   - If you see {"message":"Not found"}, the subdomain or path is incorrect.

3. **Common mistakes:**
   - Typo in the subdomain (e.g., "dataforgesys" vs. your actual account)
   - Extra or missing "/api/v1" in the URL
   - Using the wrong environment (sandbox vs. production)

4. **How to find your correct subdomain:**
   - Log in to RepairShopr in your browser. The URL in the address bar will show your subdomain.
   - Example: If you see https://acme.repairshopr.com, your subdomain is "acme".

5. **Update the plugin settings:**
   - Go to the plugin settings page in WordPress.
   - Enter the correct API URL.
   - Save and refresh the page.

6. **If you still see "Not found":**
   - Double-check the subdomain and path.
   - Contact RepairShopr support to confirm the correct API base URL for your account.

If you update the API URL and the dropdown still does not populate, provide the exact API URL you are using (mask your API key) so I can help further.
