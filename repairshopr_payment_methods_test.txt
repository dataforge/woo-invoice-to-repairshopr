# Test RepairShopr Payment Methods API

## 1. Browser Test (no authentication)
Paste this URL in your browser:
https://dataforgesys.repairshopr.com/api/v1/payment_methods

You will likely see an authentication error, but this confirms the endpoint is reachable.

## 2. Curl Test (with authentication)
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key and run this in your terminal:

curl -X GET "https://dataforgesys.repairshopr.com/api/v1/payment_methods" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY"

If successful, you should see a JSON response with payment methods.

## 3. Postman/Insomnia Test
- Set the URL to: https://dataforgesys.repairshopr.com/api/v1/payment_methods
- Set the HTTP method to GET
- Add a header: Key = Authorization, Value = YOUR_API_KEY
- Add a header: Key = accept, Value = application/json
- Send the request and check the response.

If you get a list of payment methods, your API key and URL are correct.
If you get an error, check your API key, permissions, or network connectivity.
